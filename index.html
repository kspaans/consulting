    <h1>I Help Software Companies Ship Better Code, Faster</h1>

    <p>
        Your software development process shouldn't be a black box. Whether
        you're a small business, a funded startup, or an established enterprise,
        I help companies <span class="highlight">deliver quality software on
        time</span> and <span class="highlight">build engineering teams that
        scale</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        With over 15 years of experience in software development and system
        architecture, I've helped companies and business leaders save hundreds
        of hours through improved processes, better architecture decisions, and
        strategic automation. My clients typically see ROI measured in weeks,
        not years.
    </p>

    <h2>Services That Drive Business Value</h2>

    <p>
        I offer outcome-driven, fixed-price software delivery engagements, and
        high-impact consulting services at $7,500/week or $200/hour.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Software Development & Architecture:</strong>
            Building scalable, maintainable systems that solve real business
            problems. Previous projects have included processing systems
            handling millions of messages in daily transaction volume and
            automation systems saving 100+ person-hours per week.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Technical Due Diligence & Code Review:</strong>
            Comprehensive analysis of your codebase, identifying critical
            issues before they become expensive problems. One review saved a
            client $10,000 in potential impacts from security vulnerabilities.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Engineering Team Building:</strong>
            Strategic hiring, team structure optimization, and process
            improvement. I've helped multiple startups scale from 3 to 20+
            engineers while maintaining productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Process Automation:</strong>
            Identifying and eliminating costly manual processes. Typical
            projects achieve 50%+ reduction in manual work.
        </li>
    </ul>

        planning and helped us scale
